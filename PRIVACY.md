# Privacy Policy

It is not the intention of this bot to compile personally identifiable information from users. However, by using this bot some of your information is stored internally on a private server. This document will summarize what information is collected and how it is used.

By adding this bot (FBK) to a Discord server, it is  accept and understand the policies outlined in this document.

# Data Collected

## Command Requests

As with any bot, any content provided specifically in a command or conversation with this bot will be analyzed and may be stored for debugging. Storage of preferences is required for any functionality of the bot that is configurable. This includes:

- Per-server configurations/settings
- Any additional information provided directly in a command or conversation to the bot

## Message Contents

The bot can see any message sent in your server available to it, and if any message-based features are enabled (such as Twitter or Pixiv link embedding) messages will be processed in order to provide this functionality. Beyond this, contents of arbitrary messages will **not** be stored. Full message contents are only ever stored if one of the following applies:

- The message was sent by the bot itself
- The message is directed at FBK though the use of its commands
- Message "edit" or "delete" logging is enabled in that server

## Discord IDs Collected Automatically

IDs (snowflakes) specific to Discord objects (guilds, users, channels) within your Discord server may be collected at any time. User and channel IDs are linked to Discord guilds, and role IDs may be linked to user IDs if automatic role assignment features are enabled. Usernames and channel names corresponding to these IDs are not stored.

## Other Data Collected if Enabled

If the "service integration" features including and not limited to the Twitter, YouTube, Twitch, MyAnimeList "trackers" are used, additionally information will necessarily be obtained and stored from these platforms. Any other "trackers" that may be added following a similar design pattern will similarly collect similar neccesary unique data.

- Corresponding Account username or ID required for operation 

For streaming platforms:

- Event (video upload, livestream, Tweet) unique IDs
- Event titles, live status, schedule, viewer counts, and any information added in the future which can be displayed in bot messages

Anime/manga "media list" trackers:
- Entire contents of tracked media lists necessary for detection of updates to the list 

## Usage of Collected Information

Information collected is used purely to provide you with the services and functionality offered by the bot. It is not distributed directly to any third-party excepting Discord in the form of messages on that platform.

## Data Storage and Security

Stored data is located on a secured server using well-known, secure database softwares PostgreSQL and MongoDB. No other users than myself (kabii) have access to the resources to directly access these databases. As with any database of this nature, absolute security can not be guaranteed. In the unlikely event of a data breach, and the nature of a Discord bot lacking a real direct notification system, any concern over data security would be reported on the bot Discord server.
