# Terms of Service

This Discord bot, FBK, (the "Service") is operated and maintained by sole "Owner" kabii. By accessing and using the Service, you agree to these Terms and should read them carefully. If you disagree with any Terms you should discontinue use of the Service. Violation of any Terms may result in termination of access to the Service.

**Communications**
The form of the Service (Discord bot) makes direct contact to users difficult. It is recommended to join the official Discord server (invite provided in the software repository) for updates and notices. 

**User Content**
Users acknowledge and accept that by providing their own content to the Service they grant the Owner a non-exclusive, fully paid-up, and royalty-free license to process such content solely for the operation and maintenance of this Service as contractually required.

User provided content is relayed into servers where the content is provided obviously for the functionality of a feature of the Service. Users who choose to provide content are solely liable for any content they transfer to the Service. All users acknowledge that the Owner does not filter or moderate such content.

The Owner reserves the right to remove such content at its own discretion, and to, without prior notice, deny the content creator access to this Service. The removal of content shall not entitle Users that have provided such content or that are liable for it, to any claims for compensation, damages, or reimbursement.  

Users agree to hold the Owner harmless from and against any claim asserted and/or damage suffered due to content they provided to or provided through this Website.

The Owner does not claim any intellectual property rights over content sent by the Service. Content should not be transferred to the Service without proper ownership, however User-provided content may be unpredictable. If there is a violation of IP, contact the Owner to have such content removed.
 
**Reference to External Resources**

We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party web sites or services. You further acknowledge and agree that We shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on or through any such web sites or services.

**Termination**
The Owner reserves the right to terminate your access to the Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach these Terms.

**Disclaimer**
This Service is provided strictly on an “as is” and “as available” basis. Use of the Service is at Users’ own risk. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the Owner expressly disclaims all conditions, representations, and warranties — whether express, implied, statutory, or otherwise, including, but not limited to, any implied warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of third-party rights. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by user from owner or through the Service will create any warranty not expressly stated herein. The Owner does not warrant that the content is accurate, reliable, or correct; that the Service will meet Users’ requirements; that the Service will be available at any particular time or location, uninterrupted or secure; that any defects or errors will be corrected; or that the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components. Any content downloaded or otherwise obtained through the use of the Service is downloaded at users own risk and users shall be solely responsible for any damage to Users’ computer system or mobile device or loss of data that results from such download or Users’ use of the Service. The Owner does not warrant, endorse, guarantee, or assume responsibility for any product or service advertised or offered by a third party through the Service or any hyperlinked website or service, and the Owner shall not be a party to or in any way monitor any transaction between Users and third-party providers of products or services. Federal law, some states, and other jurisdictions, do not allow the exclusion and limitations of certain implied warranties. The above exclusions may not apply to Users. Users may also have other rights which vary from state to state. 

**Limitation of Liability**
The Owner shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages, including, without limitation, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses, that result from the use of, or inability to use, this Service.

**Expectation of Availability**
The Owner reserves the right to interrupt, suspend, or terminate the Service for maintenance, modifications, or for any other reason.

Best efforts are made to make the Service available. Moving forward, the Service is still provided by an individual and as such the Service may experience inconsistent maintenance or resources at times. The User does not have an expectation to provide compensation for the Service and should not expect a defined level of service.

**Changes to these Terms**
The Owner reserves the right to modify or replace these Terms at any time. By continuing to use the service after revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.

**Miscellaneous**
Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. 
These Terms constitute the entire agreement and understanding regarding the Service, and supersede and replace and prior agreements we might have regarding the Service.
The laws of the United States of America shall govern these Terms of Service without regard to conflict of law principles.
